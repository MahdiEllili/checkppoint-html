        <i><h1>&#10152;The story of Epic Games:</h1></i>
        <h3>
          Epic Games, Inc. is an American video game and software developer and
          publisher based in Cary, North Carolina. The company was founded by
          Tim Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991, originally located in
          his parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. Following his first
          commercial video game release, ZZT (1991), the company became Epic
          MegaGames, Inc. in early 1992 and brought on Mark Rein, who is the
          company's vice president to date. Moving their headquarters to Cary in
          1999, the studio's name was simplified to Epic Games.

          <h3>
            Epic Games develops the Unreal Engine, a commercially available game
            engine which also powers their internally developed video games,
            such as Fortnite and the Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade
            series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the "most successful
            videogame engine" by Guinness World Records.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Epic Games owns video game developers Chair Entertainment and
            Psyonix, as well as cloud-based software developer Cloudgine, and
            operates eponymous sub-studios in Seattle, England, Berlin, Yokohama
            and Seoul. While Sweeney remains the majority shareholder, Tencent
            acquired a 48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic,
            in the company in 2012, as part of an agreement aimed at moving Epic
            towards a games as a service model. Following the release of the
            popular Fortnite Battle Royale in 2017, the company gained
            additional investments that enabled to expand its Unreal Engine
            offerings, establish esport events around Fortnite, and launch the
            Epic Games Store. As of August 2020, the company has a US$17.3
            billion equity valuation.
